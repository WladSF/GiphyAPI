# GiphyAPI

1. When the user clicks on a button, the page should grab 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.

2. When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif should animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it should stop playing.

3. Under every gif, its rating is displayed  (PG, G, so on).
   * This data is provided by the GIPHY API.

4. Through a form, the page takes the value from a user input box and adds it into the `topics` array. 

5. User can clear the screen and clear the new topic buttons created. 

6. New gifs are added 10 at a time to the page. They do not replace the previous gifs.
